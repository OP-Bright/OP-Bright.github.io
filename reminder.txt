note to self:

saving changes:
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push

cancelling changes:
git reset --hard

This shouldn't be a problem but for some reason gitpod really hates the idea of NOT
saving dumb changes. Also why is saving so inconvienient?!?!?!?

PERSONAL TO-DO:
Make some new art for the website, and edit the CSS to not be broken anymore.
